		A Quick Note From The Designers

First of all, thank you very much for buying Diablo. We have 
worked hard to create a game that you will want to spend many, 
many hours playing. To further that end, we have added some 
features in Diablo that may not be apparent at first glance.

Diablo is a VERY different play experience depending on which
character class you choose. The tactics and strategies employed 
by the Warrior, for instance, would be sheer folly for a 
Sorcerer to attempt. Many high level items and spells will only 
be useable by certain classes. After you defeat Diablo, try 
another game with a different character class. 

You won't be disappointed.

Diablo also randomly generates every level of the labyrinth, 
including the rooms, hallways, lights, shrines, fountains, 
cauldrons, pools, special themed areas, treasures and monsters. 
The list just goes on, but what it boils down to is each time you
enter a new level within the labyrinth, you will have new things 
to do and discover.

Finally, Diablo takes on an entirely different feel when you are in
a multiplayer game.  The interaction that occurs, the new
strategies and the difference in how you have to think all make for
a very exciting and very new experience.

Again, thank you for grabbing that Diablo box off of the shelf. 
Always remember: If you think you've found everything -- you're
wrong...

     "Speedbook" which allows you to select a skill or spell for 
     immediate use.  To use a readied skill or spell, simply 
     right-click in the main play area.


     USING ARCHITECTURE AS A TACTICAL POSITION
     There are many place in the labyrinth that the character can 
     use to his advantage when in combat. Two basic examples of 
     these are barrels and doorways.

     Barrels not only are sources of hidden treasures, but they 
     also provide excellent blocking terrain for ranged attacks. 
     Since barrels can be have spells or arrows fired over them, 
     a sorcerer or rogue properly positioned behind a cluster of 
     barrels can fight back a large group of oncoming creatures.

     Doorways can also be used very effectively for singling out 
     monsters when encountered in large groups. If you are swarmed 
     by a large group of creatures in the labyrinth, an excellent 
     tactic is to position your character just on the other side 
     of a doorway and take them on one at a time as they enter 
     into the doorway.

     There are numerous other areas within the labyrinth that can 
     be used as strong tactical positions by players who are 
     looking for them. Keep your eyes open and your weapons ready!


     RESISTANCE AND IMMUNITY
     Certain monsters in the labyrinth are resistant or even immune 
     to different types of magic. After killing several monsters of 
     the same type, your character will learn the resistances and 
     immunities that these creatures have. Unique creatures (those 
     whose names are displayed in gold text) may also have 
     resistances or immunities. While your character does not know 
     the immunities or resistances of a unique monster, he will 
     know if some type of immunity or resistance exists. 

     Should you have difficulty killing a unique monster with an 
     attack such as firebolt, the creature may have a resistance 
     or immunity to fire based attacks. Try using an electrical 
     (lightning) or magical (stone curse) attack instead.

     
     I LOVE THIS GAME, BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOO TOUGH...
     Depending on the items you find, spells you learn and 
     creatures you encounter, each game will play very 
     differently - even with characters of the same class. 
     Because of the randomness of Diablo, some labyrinths will be
     more challenging than others.  Until you are an expert 
     spelunker, you may find a dungeon too difficult.  If this is 
     the case, you can use the 'New Game' option to take your 
     character (complete with stats, experience, and inventory) 
     into a new labyrinth where you can fortify him with additional 
     gold, items, spells, and experience from earlier levels.

 2.  Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 & Microsoft DirectX

     Diablo is a Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 game that utilizes
     Microsoft DirectX. DirectX is included on the Diablo CD and 
     can be installed from the Diablo setup program.

     The version of DirectX that is included on this CD is the
     English Only variation.  Messages that are output to the
     screen will be in the English language, however, the English
     version should work properly with any international Windows 95
     installations.  If you experience any difficulties, please contact
     Microsoft by using the contact information at the bottom of this
     section.
     
     Windows NT 4.0 does not require that you install Microsoft 
     DirectX as it is already part of the operating system.

     For users who are running both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0
     on their systems, please note that multiplayer characters 
     created within one will not be available while playing 
     under the other OS (i.e., characters created while playing 
     under Windows 95 are not available while you are playing 
     under Windows NT 4.0)

     If you have difficulty running Windows 95 after these new 
     Microsoft DirectX drivers have been installed, please contact 
     Microsoft technical support at:

     USA telephone: 1-800-426-9400
     International telephone: 001-206-882-8080

 3.  Video Cards

     S3 Vision 968: If you have a video card with a Vision 968 
     chipset (Diamond Stealth 64 3000 Series, #9 Motion 771, etc.) 
     you will need to obtain the latest DirectX drivers from your 
     video card manufacturer.  As of the release date, many of 
     these cards were still not supported under DirectX 3.0.

     Tseng chipsets: If you experience problems, use the drivers 
     that come with DirectX 3.0. The drivers that are supplied by 
     Tseng are not compatible as of release date.

     S3 Virge3D: If you have a card with the Virge 3D chip, use the 
     Virge driver from the DirectX 3.0 CD and NOT the OEM driver, 
     or the driver from the video card manufacturer.

     3Dlabs GLINT Delta: As of the release date, these new graphics 
     adapters have DirectDraw drivers that do not work with some 
     applications.  You may experience occasional "hard freezes" 
     that will cause your computer to lock up.  Specific drivers 
     that support DirectX may be available in the future.

     Matrox Millennium: If you have a Matrox Millenium card and are
     experiencing random lockups or palette glitches, please
     download the latest version of the video driver from their
     website.  Also, If you are running in a "dual desktop" mode 
     with two Matrox Millennium adapters and two monitors, you must
     change the desktop size in the display properties to 1280x1024
     or less before running Diablo.
     
                 For a list of video card manufacturers
                    visit our on-line support at:
              http://www.blizzard.com/support/vendors.htm

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 4.  Sound Cards

     Aztec Sound Galaxy: You may notice music skipping on some 
     systems. This is due to incompatibilities between Windows
     DirectSound and the Aztec drivers. As of the release of
     Diablo the drivers that Aztec supply do not correct this.  
     Specific drivers that support DirectX may be available 
     in the future from Aztec.

     Diablo requires a Windows 95 compatible sound card. If you
     should encounter any problems with your sound card, make sure
     that all current Windows 95 and DirectX compatible drivers are 
     installed and, if necessary, contact your sound card 
     manufacturer.

                 For a list of sound card manufacturers
                    visit our on-line support at:
              http://www.blizzard.com/support/vendors.htm

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 5.  Virtual Memory Settings

     Diablo may need to use more RAM than is present on your system.
     Windows 95 automatically takes care of this by using what is
     known as "Virtual Memory" -- it uses space on your hard disk
     to simulate the memory it needs and swaps data back and forth
     from your hard disk as required. Windows 95 allows you to 
     manually set the amount of hard drive space it uses for 
     Virtual Memory.

     In our experience, we have found that letting Windows 95
     manage your Virtual Memory is easiest and best for performance. 
     To let Windows 95 manage your virtual memory, go to the 
     Windows 95 START menu, select SETTINGS, CONTROL PANEL, then 
     double-click SYSTEM, click PERFORMANCE, FILE SYSTEM, 
     VIRTUAL MEMORY and then select "Let Windows manage my virtual
     memory settings (recommended)".

     If you are running low on virtual memory, you may need to free 
     up space on your hard drive.

 6.  Multiplayer Diablo

     6.a.  Playing Diablo over Battle.net

     Battle.net is an Internet gaming service provided by Blizzard
     Entertainment which allows players to meet up, challenge other 
     players, and join games, all without paying any special 
     connection charges.

     In order to use Battle.net, your computer must have the TCP/IP 
     protocol installed, and must provide TCP/IP support for 32-bit 
     applications.  If you connect to the Internet using Windows 
     Dial-up Networking, and browse the web with Netscape Navigator 
     version 2.0 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, 
     then you probably already have the correct TCP/IP software 
     installed.  However, if you connect to the Internet with a
     proprietary dialer or browse the web with Netscape 1.x or 
     another 16-bit web browser, then it is likely that your system
     is not configured to support 32-bit applications.  In this 
     case, you should contact your Internet Service Provider to 
     obtain updated software.

     "I can chat with other users, but I can't join a game."

     In order to play in a multiplayer game, your system must be 
     able to receive packets of game data (technically, UDP packets) 
     from other players.  Some service providers don't allow 
     incoming data of this type, or don't provide users with a 
     unique Internet address to which packets can be sent.  If you 
     are unsure whether your provider is blocking this type of 
     connection, please contact them for more information.

     If you are trying to play Diablo through a computer that is 
     directly connected to the Internet through your employer or 
     other organization, you should be aware that some companies 
     block certain types of incoming data to their networks.  To 
     play multiplayer games on Battle.net, you may have to ask 
     your network administrator to allow incoming UDP packets on 
     port 6112.

     6.b.  Connecting to Battle.net through America Online

     To connect to Battle.net through AOL, you will need to
     use the 32-bit Windows 95 AOL client software. If you are 
     unsure as to whether you already have this, please contact 
     AOL directly.

     Also, AOL's connection to the Internet is often very slow, 
     which can make multiplayer games between AOL users and users 
     of other service providers almost unplayable.

     6.c.  Playing Diablo over a Local Area Network

     Diablo supports multiplayer gaming over IPX-compatible 
     networks.  If your computer is connected to a local area 
     network, but you are not sure whether it is IPX compatible or 
     not, ask your network administrator.

     "I have IPX but I can't join a game, or people can't join my 
      game."

     Diablo will not play across network segments.  If you are not 
     sure whether your network is segmented or not, contact your 
     network administrator.

     You should also verify that all computers on the network are
     using the same frame type.  You can change the frame type that
     a computer uses in the Network section of the Control Panel.

     For more detailed information on setting up and diagnosing
     troubles with a Local Area Network, please see the Network.doc
     file on the Diablo CD.

     6.d.  Playing Diablo over a Modem

     To play Diablo over a modem, you must ensure that your modem 
     is configured properly in the Microsoft Windows Modems control 
     panel.

     "My modem won't dial a number or answer an incoming call."

     Here are some things to try:
      - Disable any messaging software such as Comm. Central or any 
        other answering machine software.
      - Disable any Fax software that is installed on your system.
      - Close any other programs which may be using the modem.

     You should also verify that your modem's INIT string is 
     correct.  Your modem manufacturer will be able to help you 
     with this.  For more detailed information on setting
     up and diagnosing troubles with a Local Area Network, please
     see the Modem.doc file on the Diablo CD.

     6.e.  Playing Diablo over a Serial Cable Connection

     You can play Diablo head to head using a null modem cable.  
     Simply connect the null modem cable to a free serial port on 
     each computer and select Direct Cable Connection from within 
     Diablo.  One player should then select Create Game; the other 
     should wait until the game is running, then select Retry 
     Connection to join it.

     "My direct link setup isn't working."
     "I can get multiplayer games started, but they lock up during 
      gameplay."

     You must ensure that the serial port you are using is 
     correctly configured in the Windows control panel.  Also, 
     verify that it is not being used by other applications, and 
     that it does not have an IRQ conflict with another serial 
     port, modem, or mouse on your system.  If you are unsure how 
     to do this, read the file Serial.doc on the Diablo CD.

     "Is it true that Diablo supports up to four-player serial 
      games through daisy-chained serial cables?"

     Yes.  However, this process is complicated and is recommended 
     only for technically advanced users.  For more information, 
     see the file Serial.doc on the Diablo CD.

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 7.  Software Compatibility

     7.a.  Microsoft PowerToys

     If you have the Microsoft PowerToys system extensions 
     installed you may experience a black screen upon booting 
     Diablo, although the sounds may still be audible. If this 
     happens, you should remove the Microsoft PowerToys while 
     playing Diablo. 

     7.b.  NEC Merlin

     If you are using a NEC computer with the Merlin assistant, 
     you may experience video problems when starting the game. 
     If this happens, disable Merlin by removing the icon from your
     Startup menu and rebooting your computer.  For additional
     information, contact NEC technical support at (800) 632-4554.

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 8.  Video Playback

     If video playback is slow or choppy on your system, you can
     adjust the size of the playback window using the VidSize
     utility, which is installed in the Diablo directory.

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 9.  Updates, Patches & General Troubleshooting

     !!!!!!! Diablo 1.04 Patch !!!!!!!
     
     In the root directory of the CD-ROM you will find the Diablo
     1.04 patch.  The file is named DRTL104.EXE and can be installed
     simply by double-clicking on the icon.  If you choose not to
     install this patch, you will be required to download the it
     upon playing over the Battle.net for the first time.  It is
     recommended that you install this patch prior to playing Diablo
     for the first time, as it allows for more stable gameplay.
     
     You can check Blizzard's web site (http://www.blizzard.com) 
     for the latest information on updates and patches for Diablo.  
     Also, whenever you connect to Battle.net, your software will 
     automatically be upgraded to the latest version.  For more 
     information on Battle.net, see the "Playing Diablo over 
     Battle.net" section in this file.

     IMPROVING GAME SPEED
     There is a possibility of slower game play on slower systems 
     while music is playing. For better performance, the music 
     volume should be set to zero.  Music and sound volumes may be 
     set by using the Options menu while playing Diablo.

     You can change the cache size of your CD-ROM to increase 
     performance and decrease CD load times. This can be done by 
     opening the START menu from your task bar, selecting SETTINGS 
     and then opening the CONTROL PANELS folder. Now open your 
     SYSTEM properties file and select the PERFORMANCE tab. Click 
     on the FILE SYSTEMS button and select the CD-ROM tab. Every 
     CD-ROM uses different cache sizes and access patterns, so you 
     may need to experiment with these to find the optimum setting 
     for your CD-ROM. If you have less than 16MB of RAM, you will 
     want to set your cache size to as low as possible. If you have 
     more than 16MB of RAM and are experiencing slowdown, you can 
     increase cache size if possible.

     Another method of increasing performance in Diablo is to add
     RAM to your computer if you are playing on an 8MB system. 
     Windows 95 uses about 2.5 MB of your available RAM, and
     this causes Diablo to use virtual memory. This process is 
     slower than using RAM directly, and while the speed of your 
     processor is a factor in the performance of the game, 
     additional memory can greatly enhance your game speed on 
     baseline systems.

     PROGRAM CONFLICTS
     Diablo is a Windows 95 program that is capable of running 
     while other programs are running in the background.  For
     best performance we suggest you shut down all other programs  
     (including your Microsoft Office toolbar) while playing.

     MULTIPLE CD CHANGERS
     Diablo supports the use of multiple CD-ROM drives and CD 
     changers on a single system, so please feel free to play 
     your Diablo CD from any properly configured CD-ROM drive.

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

10.  Uninstalling

     10.a Uninstalling Diablo

     Diablo can be uninstalled from the Autorun menu or through
     the Diablo group in your start menu. When uninstalling Diablo, 
     you will be asked if you also wish to delete your saved games. 
     Checking this box will delete all saved games of Diablo. 
     Should you wish to keep your saved games on your hard drive, 
     DO NOT check this box when prompted.

     For users who are running both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0
     on their systems, please note that you must uninstall Diablo 
     from the same OS where it was installed (i.e. if you install
     Diablo under Windows 95, you must uninstall from Windows 95
     as well).


     10.b Uninstalling Battle.net

     To uninstall Battle.net you will need to open the START menu 
     from your task bar. Open the CONTROL PANELS folder and select 
     ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS.  You will see Battle.net in the program 
     list and to remove it, select Battle.net and click the 
     Add/Remove button.
